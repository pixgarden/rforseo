# Crawling with rvest

If you want to crawl a couple of URLs for SEO purposes, there are many ways to do it but one of the most reliable and versatile packages you can use is the [rvest](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/) package.

Here is a [simple demo](https://stat4701.github.io/edav/2015/04/02/rvest\_tutorial/) from the package documentation using the IMDb website:

```r
# Package installation, instruction to be run only once
install.packages("rvest") 
# Loading rvest 
packagelibrary(rvest)
```

The first step is to crawl the URL and store the webpage inside a ‚Äòlego\_movie‚Äô variable.

```r
lego_movie <- read_html("http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1490017/")
```

Quite straightforward, isn‚Äôt it?

_`lego_move`_ is an _xml\_document_ that need to be parse in order to extract the data. Here is how to do it:

```r
rating <- lego_movie %>%
   html_nodes("strong span") %>%
   html_text() %>%
   as.numeric()
```

For those who don‚Äôt know **%>%** operator here is [simple explanation](../r-intro.md#the-greater-than)\
\
_html\_nodes_() function will extract from our webpage, HTML tags that match CSS style query selector. In this case, we are looking for a \<span> tag whose parent is a \<strong> tag.\
then script will extract the inner text value using _html\_text_() then convert it to a number using _as.numeric_().

Finally, it will store this value inside _rating_ variable to display the value just write:

```r
rating 
# it should display > [1] 7.8
```

Let‚Äôs take another example. This time we are going to grab the movies‚Äô cast.\
\
Having a look at the HTML DOM, it seems that we need to grab an HTML \<img> tag who‚Äôs parent tag have ‚ÄòtitleCast‚Äô as an id and ‚Äòprimary\_photo‚Äô as a class name and then we‚Äôll need to extract the alt attribute

```r
cast <- lego_movie %>%
   html_nodes("#titleCast .primary_photo img") %>%
   html_attr("alt")

cast 
# Should display:# >  [1] "Will Arnett"     "Elizabeth Banks" "Craig Berry"# >  [4] "Alison Brie"     "David Burrows"   "Anthony Daniels"# >  [7] "Charlie Day"     "Amanda Farinos"  "Keith Ferguson"# > [10] "Will Ferrell"    "Will Forte"      "Dave Franco"# > [13] "Morgan Freeman"  "Todd Hansen"     "Jonah Hill"

```

Last example, we want the movie poster url. First step is to grab \<img> tag who‚Äôs parent have a class name ‚Äòposter‚Äô Then extract src attribute and display it

```r
poster <- lego_movie %>%
   html_nodes(".poster img") %>%
   html_attr("src")

poster 
# Shoudl display:# [1] "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg4MDk1ODExN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzIyNjg3MDE@.<em>V1_UX182_CR0,0,182,268_AL</em>.jpg"
```

### Now a real-life crawl example

Now that we‚Äôve seen an example by the book. We‚Äôll switch to something more useful and a little bit more complex. Using the following tutorial, you‚Äôll be able to extract the review score of any WordPress plugins over time.

For example here are the stats for [**Yoast**](https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/), the famous SEO plugin:![](https://www.gokam.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/yoast.png)

Here are the ones‚Äô for[ **All in one SEO**](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/), his competitor![](https://www.gokam.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/all-in-one-seo.png)

Very useful to follow if your favourite plugin new release is well received [or not.](https://twitter.com/tuf/status/1229363279388082176)

But before that, a little warning, the source code I‚Äôm about to show you has been made by me. It‚Äôs full of flaws, couple of stack overflow copypasta but‚Ä¶ it works. üòÖ So Dear practitioners please don‚Äôt judge me\
It‚Äôs one of the beauties of R, you get your ends relatively easily.

(but I gladly accept any ideas to make this code easier for beginner, don‚Äôt hesitate to contact me)

So let‚Äôs get to it, the first step is to grab a [reviews page](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-fastest-cache/reviews/) URL. On this one, we have 49 pages of reviews.

We‚Äôll have to make a loop to run into each pagination. Another problem is that no dates are being displayed but only durations, so we‚Äôll have to convert them.

As usual, we‚Äôll first load the necessary packages. If there are not installed yet, run the install.packages() function as seen before.

```r
#Loading packages
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
```

```r
# we store plugin url inside a variable, to make the code easy to reuse
pluginurl <- "https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-fastest-cache/"
 
# we create and empty dataframe to receive the data that will be retrieved from each pagination. If you don't know what's a data frame think of them as excel file
all_reviews <- data.frame()
 
#####   beginning of the LOOP ####
# if copy past stuff, don't forget to grab the code until the end of the loop at least
for(i in 1:49) {
 
# sending to console the loop status
# paste0() function is just a concatenation function with a weird name
message(paste0("Page ",i))
 
# faculative: make a small break betweeh each loop iteration
# this pause the loop for 2 secondes
# Sys.sleep(2)
 
# we grab the webpage and store the result inside html_page variable to be able to reuse it several times
 html_page <- read_html(paste0(pluginurl,"reviews/page/",i,"/")) 
 
# html_nodes is function that use the css or xpath to extract the value from the html page. This part is to extract the number of stars
 reviews <- html_nodes(html_page, ".wporg-ratings")
```

If you need help to select elements, chrome inspector is great. You can copy/paste xpath and .css style selector directly:![](https://www.gokam.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-04-14.00.37-1024x672.png)

```r
# Then we are getting every htmml attributes values into columns and rows
# it's a copy/past from stackoverflow, it's works don't ask me how.
 extract <- bind_rows(lapply(xml_attrs(reviews), function(x) data.frame(as.list(x), stringsAsFactors=FALSE)))
```

In other words, it transforms this HTML data hard to deal with![](https://www.gokam.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-06-14.50.55-1024x412.png)

into a clean data frame with nice columns![](https://www.gokam.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-06-14.51.36.png)

```r
# using the extract() function get the number of stars
extract <- extract %>% extract(title,c("note"))
 
# same process but this time to extract the duration
# Grabing from the html file, the duration being displayed
dates <- html_nodes(html_page, ".bbp-topic-freshness")
 
# Extracting the real duration value from text: we remove line breaks and what's after "ago"
 extract$dates <- html_text(dates, trim = T) %>%  str_replace_all("[\r|\n|\t]" , "") %>% str_replace_all(" ago.*$" , "")
 
# apply duration type to values, necessary for future conversions
# more info https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/reference/duration.html
extract$duration <- lubridate::as.duration(extract$dates)
 
 
# removing from the data frame the now useless columns & rows
 extract$class <- NULL
 extract$title <- NULL
 extract$style <- NULL
 extract$note$class <-NULL
 extract$note$style <- NULL
 extract <- extract[-1,]
 
# erase rownames
 rownames(extract) <- c()
 
# converte values to the right type
 extract$note <- as.vector(extract$note)
 extract$note <- as.numeric(extract$note)
 
# adding all date retrieved during this loop to the main data frame 'all_reviews' 
 all_reviews <- rbind(all_reviews, extract)   
 
##### END OF THE LOOP #####
 
 }
```

The next step is to convert these durations into days. It‚Äôs going to be quick:

```r
# .Data is the number of seconds, we divided by 86400 to have the number of days and we round it
all_reviews$duration2 <- round(all_reviews$duration@.Data/86400)
 
# Today date minus review age will give us the review date 
all_reviews$day <- today()-all_reviews$duration2
```

```r
# we want to see number of stars as a category not as a scale
all_reviews$note <- as.factor(all_reviews$note)
```

the data is now ready, [export your data ](https://www.gokam.co.uk/export-your-data-from-r/)or make a small graph to display it using ggplot package

```r
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(all_reviews, aes(x=day, fill=note))+
   geom_histogram()
```
