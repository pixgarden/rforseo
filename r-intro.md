# About this Book

_This guide, **in the course of writing**, is dedicated to all those who share their knowledge online and especially Hamlet Batista. I'm not a Python user like him and I just came across the guy once but his disappearance made us all remember that sharing is caring and that Life is so damn short._

### 1.1 Motivation & limits

Even though R'  is a terrific option for SEO, there are simply not enough resources out there.&#x20;

This guide is not here to deliver a course about R, there are plenty already. This guide is meant to be as practical as possible. How things should be done in an "R-ish way" is not the purpose of this guide. \
Grab what you want to grab and feel free to reach if you have a better solution, I'll add it giving you credit.
